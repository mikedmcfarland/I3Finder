I3Finder
========

Scala application for the i3 tiling window manager which launches Dmenu with all current workspaces / windows / tags as choices.
Separate command line options for pulling the choice to your current focused location, or focusing the choice.

# Note
this is pretty useless now that I've made an equivalent node script [here](https://github.com/mikedmcfarland/node-i3finder). Since javas startup times make this decently slow enough to make me feel like rewriting it (that was even when utilizing Drip).
